</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Summary: Data Analytics Library is 
A tool for UTC engineers to create &amp; verify data analytics’ business value agilely; 
A sandbox for data scientist to explore new ideas;
A framework for users to assemble, evaluate, package and deploy seamlessly.</p>
<h2><strong>Project Goal</strong></h2>
<p>Most UTC products are data-intensive complex SCADA system like HVAC transplant system or fire and egress system . There are more than 10,000 VAVs, 200 AHUs, and 20 FAUs installed in a landmark building.
On the one hand, SCADA suffers from improper operation by  authenticated client. On the other hand, monotomous control logic can not adopt to various environment conditions with human in the loop.
With the trend of industry 4.0, building owners request an intelligent self-adaptive automation control panel or dashboard that can provide context-aware performance prediction based on historical energy consumption pattern.</p>
<h2><strong>My Responsibility &amp; Deliverables</strong></h2>
<h3>1 Painpoint identification &amp; BI/Enterprise analytics platform benchmark</h3>
<p><img src="/static/dal_persona.png", width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p>The ordinary engineers should be the primary users of this data analytics platform. They have the need to use a standardized/repeatable data analytics process to handle the regular analytics-related tasks. The data scientists usually use open source library (i.e. python, R) to do data analytics, but have the need to speed up the data integration and preparation process. The business user such as call center manager should be the person who has the need to promote customer service by analyzing correlation between callbacks and complaints. The library admin should be the person who review, test and release new version. 
Constraints 
The scope is building data, not targeting to general data analytics, the data main source is DIP (data integration platform). The project targets to enable better and faster building analytics services development and deployment, use cases should link to this target.
•    no video data and analytics in 2017. Target to multi-system data analytics (i.e. HVAC + Elevator) as it goes into 2018/2019. 
•   Algorithm coding language is Python</p>
<h3>2 Online questionnaire for internal user persona (Data-analytics-skill capability and tool)</h3>
<p><img src="/static/dal_improvement_questionnaire.png", width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p>[Questionnaire link] (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QSSVK83)</p>
<p><img src="/static/dal_usecase_pipeline.png", width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Painpoint of DAL1.0</strong>
The slow, difficult and error-prone process at the scale of petabytes is  hard to extract insights or actions.
Bottom-up fault detection diagnostics with component-level univariate data only covers microscopic root cause of performance problems, but lacking system-level macaronic overview.
Model trained from lab facility cannot apply to others due to various human intervention and environmental complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3 Interactive data visualization tool literature review and competitive analysis</h3>
<p><strong>3.1 Benchmark Solution to current DAL</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/dal_benchmark_similarity_search.png", width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p>Convert system log data into temporal event/action sequence. This step is to extract finite factors based on domain knowledge. It also normalized/rescale the system log into meaningful interval.
Similarity search for comparison is an empirical diagnose approach widely used in health-care organization conducted by human doctor/operator. 
LifeFlow allow doctors to quickly search patient records with similar sequence among thousands of records and compare the current case with best practice in history.
It use bar diagram to summarizes all possible sequences, and highlights the temporal spacing of the events within sequences.</p>
<p>Is a GUI facilitate analysis query and data transformation over temporal-event dataset. Unlike the simple logic of pure time point data/or pure time interval data in previous two cases. In the third case, researcher want to find patterns between Stroke symptom and two medication treatment, Drag A and Drag B.
There are three dimension here  Point v.s.Interval, Presence v.s. absence, and whether there is overlap among points and intervals. Stroke is a time point data while medication treatment is time interval data. 
How to construct an arbitrary index or scale to compress big data without losing its information.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Mortif similarity search for building energy visualization</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/dal_benchmark_mortif_energy.png", width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use Motif Analysis to find most common daily profile of a building energy consumption.
Bottom-up fault detection diagnostics with component-level univariate data only covers microscopic root cause of performance problems, but lacking system-level macaronic overview.
Eventflow analytics gives an example why analytics is complex in real world.</p>
<p>-<strong> Step 2 Symbolic Aggregate appoXimation (SAX) transformation:</strong></p>
<p>Domain knowledge breakdown 24-hour into four chunks:
 12 a.m~6 a.m, 
 6 a.m.~12p.m., 
 12p.m.~6p.m., 
 6pp.m.~12a.m.
remove outlier falls outside of three standard deviations 3s
Standardize the mean of each segment
Probability density function see standard score falls in which quarter</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3 Daily profile tagging &amp; filtering:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the alphabet from each chunk. A text string is combined with four alphabets from each chunk as daily profile.
Domain knowledge to check such transformation.
Transformation allows the use of hashing, filtering, and clustering techniques
Set threshold to distinguish between motifs and discords
Threshold can be based on the text frequency count for each pattern as a percentage of the count of all observations (day profiles). </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4 Clustering</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>k-means for clustering the daily profiles pattern(suffix tree) considering simplicity for this small data size. 
Sankey diagram illustrates the divisions according to pattern  from general to rare.
Heat map represents a single daily profile to illustrate consumption magnitude of each SAX suffix tree. </p>
